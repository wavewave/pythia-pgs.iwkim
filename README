Please note that if there is a pythia_card.dat and the pythia-pgs
package is installed in the default location (see item 1 below),
pythia will be run automatically when you generate events with MadEvent.

To run Pythia on an event file:
-------------------------------

1) Make sure the pythia-pgs package is unpacked in the MG_ME_v4.x.x
   directory

2) Do "make" in the pythia-pgs/ directory

3) Go to the MyProcDir/Events/ directory, or where the .lhe event file
   is situated.

4) Make sure there is a pythia_card.dat in ../Cards/ 
   This file should be edited to correspond to your needs for the
   run.

5) Run ../bin/run_pythia
   If your pythia executable is not in the default position relative
   to your present working directory, you need to supply the path to
   it as command line argument

6) The resulting STDHEP file is called pythia_events.hep

To run PGS on a STDHEP file:
----------------------------

Follow the steps above, with "pythia" replaced by "pgs"
The input file must be called pythia_events.hep
The output file will be called pgs_events.lhco
